# Prework - SalaMobile

Submitted by: Andrew Sala

SalaMobile is an app that displays the app creator's name, college, and future job title. It includes a button that can be pressed to change the background to a random color.

Time spent: 2-3 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [X] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 
 

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

A list of my favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them my favorite app:

- Apple Notes: simplistic UI, ability to sync between devices
- Apple Photos App: document style organization, automatically created memories albums, metadata on specific photos
- Venmo: clean UI, ease of use
- myHomework: setup of UI with calendar and tasks underneath, sync between devices
- YouTube: clean UI


An app idea that I would like to build:

Team workout app: Agoogle classroom for group workouts targeting sports teams and any type of workout classes. A strength and conditioning coach would have players join their group and they can assign workout times to either the entire team or specific players. When the time comes kids will check in for attendance then they will see the full workout and they can track their weight and reps. Then in the future when  they are assigned the same exercise they will easily see their PR and their previous weight and reps. I see it as an easy way for a coach to track their clients and it can be used in many capacities.
